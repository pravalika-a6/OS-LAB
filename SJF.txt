Aim : Write a program for Shortest Job First (or SJF) CPU Scheduling

Algorithm:
-->These algorithms schedule processes in the order in which the shortest job is done first. 
-->It has a minimum average waiting time.
-->There are 3 factors to consider while solving SJF, they are
    a.BURST Time
    b.Average waiting time
    c.Average turnaround time

1. Sort all the process according to the arrival time.
2. Then select that process which has minimum arrival time and minimum Burst time.
3. After completion of process make a pool of process which after till the completion of
    previous process and select that process among the pool which is having minimum Burst time.

4. Completion Time: Time at which process completes its execution.
5. Turn Around Time: Time Difference between completion time and arrival time. 
6. Turn Around Time = Completion Time – Arrival Time
7. Waiting Time(W.T): Time Difference between turn around time and burst time.
8. Waiting Time = Turn Around Time – Burst Time
