Aim : Write a C program to simulate the Bankers Algorithm for Deadlock Avoidance. 

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Get the values of resources and processes.
3. Get the avail value.
4. After allocation find the need value.
5. Check whether it is possible to allocate.
6. If it is possible then the system is in safe state.
7. Else system is not in safety state.
8. If the new request comes then check that the system is in safety.
9. Or not if we allow the request.
10. Stop the program.
