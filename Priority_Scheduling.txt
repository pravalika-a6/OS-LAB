Aim - Write a program to Priority Scheduling

Algorithm :

Step 1: Start the process
Step 2: Accept the number of processes in the ready Queue
Step 3: For each process in the ready Q, assign the process id and accept the CPU burst time
Step 4: Sort the ready queue according to the priority number.
Step 5: Set the waiting of the first process as ‘0’ and its burst time as its turn around time
Step 6: For each process in the Ready Q calculate
         (a) Waiting time for process(n)= waiting time of process (n-1) + Burst time of process(n-1)
         (b) Turn around time for Process(n)= waiting time of Process(n)+ Burst time for process(n)
Step 7: Calculate
         (a) Average waiting time = Total waiting Time / Number of process
         (b) Average Turnaround time = Total Turnaround Time / Number of process
Step 8: Stop the process
